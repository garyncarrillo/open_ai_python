When it comes to starting the new year strong and getting a jump on your 2019 goals, what's your single biggest challenge right now?

"To condense it all down to what I really want to do but also am wanting to make sure itâ€™s right for me too. Like I have soooo many ways I could go( launching a lifestyle blog-been on the back burner for three years! But no more procrastinating.)  Plus, am a widow with two young men still at home. I want to crystallize it all , still down to the most crucial, best of the best goals. Hope that helps!"

"I'm trying to decide what type of business I want. I don't know what to focus in because I have a few things I could do, but I'm not sure how to monetize."

"To write everyday and create desirable content for a blog that helps others find happiness in the struggles in anything going on in life."

"I  am a pretty disciplined person but find myself spinning my wheels  when reaching for my goals."

"Determining where to prioriize and allocate my time. Torn between full time job, side job I want to be full time job, working towards an MBA"

"Knowing exactly what to do and how to practically get to my end goal."
